<h2>Deepfake text detection</h2>
The motivation behind this project is to develop robust methods to identify "deepfake" text. Generative models can generate fake news and fake reviews, which compromises information integrity on the internet. I designed and implemented several attacks against existing defenses for deepfake text and show that the existing defenses break in an adversarial setting. I am now developing more robust defenses by creating unsupervised knowledge graphs using language models and using these to build classifiers that detect factual and semantic inconsistencies in machine-generated text to construct model-agnostic defenses.
