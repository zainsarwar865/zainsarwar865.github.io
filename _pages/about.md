<h1>About me</h1>
I am a recent graduate from Lahore University of Management Sciences with a major in Economics and a minor in Computer Science. I am currently working as a research assistant under the supervision of Professor Mobin Javed(LUMS) and Professor Bimal Viswanath(Virginia Tech). My research interests lie in integrating the underlying mechanisms which allow the human brain to perform higher-order thinking into deep learning models. I will be starting my PhD at the University Of Chicago under the supervision of Professor Ben Y. Zhao and Professor Heather Zheng in the Fall of '21.
