<h1>About me</h1>

I am a first-year PhD student at the University Of Chicago in the department of Computer Science. I work in the <a href="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/">SAND Lab</a> where I am being advised by Professor <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~htzheng/"> Heather Zheng </a> and Professor <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/"> Ben Zhao </a>. I am interested in developing efficient and robust neural architectures for Natural Language Processing.
