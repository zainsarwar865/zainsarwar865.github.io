<h1>About me<\h1>
I am a recent graduate from Lahore University of Management Sciences with a major in Economics and a minor in Computer Science. I am currently working as a research assistant under the supervision of Professor Mobin Javed(LUMS) and Professor Bimal Viswanath(Virginia Tech). My research interests lie at the intersection of security and machine learning. I am also interested in how to integrate the underlying mechanisms which allow the human brain to perform higher-order thinking into deep learning models.
