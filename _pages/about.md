<h3>About me</h3>

I am a third-year PhD student at the University Of Chicago in the department of Computer Science. I am being advised by Professor Michael Maire. <br>
My current research is in two areas. Firstly, I'm working on developing a framework for boosting deep learning models by efficiently finding the most useful data in external datasets using supervised and unsupervised algorithms. This framework can be used to value large-scale private datasets in data markets. Secondly, I am working on several aspects of LLMs such as designing sparse transformers and improved retrieval strategies for RAG.

In the past, I've worked on detecting text generated by LLMs, video and virtual reality based keystroke inference attacks and designing voice anonmyzing tools to prevent against voice cloning attacks. 

And before that, I was interested in auction theory and behavioral economics as an Economics major.
